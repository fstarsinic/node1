  "description": "This is a sample team game Server based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.  You can find out more about Swagger at [https://swagger.io](https://swagger.io). In the third iteration of the team game, we've switched to the design first approach! You can now help us improve the API whether it's by making changes to the definition itself or to the code. That way, with time, we can improve the API in general, and expose some of the new features in OAS3.  _If you're looking for the Swagger 2.0/OAS 2.0 version of teamgame, then click [here](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://teamgame.swagger.io/v2/swagger.yaml). Alternatively, you can load via the `Edit > Load teamgame OAS 2.0` menu option!_  Some useful links: - [The team game repository](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-teamgame) - [The source API definition for the team game](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-teamgame/blob/master/src/main/resources/openapi.yaml)",
