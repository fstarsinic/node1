title Design for API calls
actor       User       as User
participant Server as Webserver
participant Router as Router
participant Controller as Cnt
participant Service as Svc
participant DBLayer as Model
database    Database    as DB

User -> Webserver : REST Call (HTTP Request)
Webserver -> Webserver: Lookup Endpoint/Route
Webserver -> Router: Execute
Router -> Cnt: Execute 
Cnt -> Svc: Send Request

Svc -> Model: Request Data A
note right 
One call to the Service layer 
often results in just 1 
call to the database layer
but could be many.
end note
Svc -> Model: Request Data B

Model -> DB: Get Resultset from Database A
Model -> DB: Get Resultset from Database B 

DB -> Model: Return Rows A
DB -> Model: Return Rows B

Model -> Svc: Return Rows A
Model -> Svc: Return Rows B

Svc -> Svc: Execute Business Logic
Svc -> Cnt: JSON
Cnt -> Router: JSON
Router -> Webserver: JSON
Webserver -> User: JSON
